    <p>Good evening,</p>
    <p>
        As you're all already aware. A circular regarding conduction of end semester exams was circulated today by the
        admin. The circular starts with the warm rosy image that MIT is keen on projecting to the world.
        We see it in the MAHE ads everyday. But both you and I know this is simply not true. The admin is hellbent upon
        keeping exams, simply due to the inflexibility of their structure. They have had multiple chances to reconstruct
        the academics but every decision taken has only hurt us.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is no surprise that this reduction in exam time is another move to suppress the rising student voice.
        I do not need to tell you the hardships we've all faced during the 2nd wave. The college refuses to acknowledge
        them and pushes us even harder.
    </p>

    <p>
        The voice of a singular student is inaudible but together we can make the college listen. After the PEXA fiasco
        we
        now know that the college is not a fort knox, it will listen if we're loud enough.
        THE STRENGTH LIES IN NUMBERS.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hereby request you all to let the college know our grievances through the only medium we have - Twitter.
        Please RETWEET, LIKE and SHARE to increase reach.
